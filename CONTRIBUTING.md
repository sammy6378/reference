### Writing Guidelines

When contributing to the documentation, please follow these guidelines:

#### Content Guidelines

- **Use clear, simple language** that beginners can understand
- **Provide practical examples** with working code snippets
- **Include explanations** for complex concepts
- **Use proper markdown formatting** with headers, lists, and code blocks
- **Add emojis** sparingly to make content more engaging
- **Test all code examples** before submitting

#### Code Examples

- Use **syntax highlighting** with appropriate language tags
- Provide **complete, runnable examples** when possible
- Add **comments** to explain complex code
- Follow **best practices** for the respective technology
- Include **error handling** where appropriate

#### Style Guide

- Use **sentence case** for headings
- Use **bullet points** for lists
- Use **numbered lists** for step-by-step instructions
- Use **callout boxes** (:::tip, :::info, :::warning) for important notes
- Use **inline code** for variable names, function names, and short code snippets

### Example Contribution

Here's an example of a well-formatted documentation section:

```markdown
## Array Methods

JavaScript provides many built-in methods to work with arrays efficiently.

### map() Method

The `map()` method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

:::tip Pro Tip
Always use `map()` when you need to transform array elements. It's more functional and readable than traditional loops.

```

## üîÑ Submitting Changes

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/improve-javascript-docs
   ```

1. **Make your changes** and test them locally
1. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive message:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add advanced array methods documentation"
   ```

1. **Push to your fork**:

   ```bash

   ```

1. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - A clear title describing your changes
   - A detailed description of what you've added or fixed
   - Screenshots if you've made visual changes
   - References to any related issues

### Branch Naming Conventions

To help with code reviews and project organization, please follow these branching guidelines:

#### Branch Naming Format

Use the following format for your branch names:

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

#### Branch Types

| Type       | Purpose                    | Example                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New features or content    | `feat/add-async-await-tutorial`        |
| `fix`      | Bug fixes or corrections   | `fix/broken-links-javascript-section`  |
| `docs`     | Documentation improvements | `docs/improve-contributing-guide`      |
| `style`    | Design/UI improvements     | `style/enhance-mobile-navigation`      |
| `refactor` | Code/content restructuring | `refactor/reorganize-beginner-content` |
| `test`     | Adding or fixing tests     | `test/add-code-example-validation`     |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks          | `chore/update-dependencies`            |

#### Branch Naming Examples

‚úÖ **Good Examples:**

```bash
feat/typescript-generics-tutorial
fix/incorrect-array-examples
docs/update-installation-guide
style/improve-code-block-styling
refactor/split-large-javascript-file
```

‚ùå **Avoid:**

```bash
my-changes
update
fix-stuff
new-feature
```

#### Creating and Working with Branches

1. **Create a new branch** from main:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main  # Sync with latest changes
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** and commit regularly:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: Clear description of what you added"
   ```

3. **Push your branch** to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request** with a clear title matching your branch purpose

### Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages that follow this format:

```
<Type>: <Short description>

[Optional longer description]
```

**Examples:**

```bash
feat: Add TypeScript interfaces tutorial
fix: Correct array method examples in beginner guide
docs: Update contribution guidelines with branch naming
style: Improve responsive design for mobile devices
```

**Types for commits:**

- `feat:` New features or content
