### Writing Guidelines

When contributing to the documentation, please follow these guidelines:

#### Content Guidelines

- **Use clear, simple language** that beginners can understand
- **Provide practical examples** with working code snippets
- **Include explanations** for complex concepts
- **Use proper markdown formatting** with headers, lists, and code blocks
- **Add emojis** sparingly to make content more engaging
- **Test all code examples** before submitting

#### Code Examples

- Use **syntax highlighting** with appropriate language tags
- Provide **complete, runnable examples** when possible
- Add **comments** to explain complex code
- Follow **best practices** for the respective technology
- Include **error handling** where appropriate

#### Style Guide

- Use **sentence case** for headings
- Use **bullet points** for lists
- Use **numbered lists** for step-by-step instructions
- Use **callout boxes** (:::tip, :::info, :::warning) for important notes
- Use **inline code** for variable names, function names, and short code snippets

### Example Contribution

Here's an example of a well-formatted documentation section:

```markdown
## Array Methods

JavaScript provides many built-in methods to work with arrays efficiently.

### map() Method

The `map()` method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

:::tip Pro Tip
Always use `map()` when you need to transform array elements. It's more functional and readable than traditional loops.
