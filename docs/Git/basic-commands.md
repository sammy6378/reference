# Basic Git Commands

Great start! Now, let’s learn the most important Git commands. These are your tools for saving, viewing, and sharing your work.

## Common Commands

- `git init`: Start a new Git repository
- `git status`: See what’s changed
- `git add`: Stage changes for commit
- `git commit`: Save your changes
- `git log`: View commit history

Example workflow:

```bash
git init
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add homepage"
git status
git log
```

:::tip
Use clear commit messages so you remember what changed!
