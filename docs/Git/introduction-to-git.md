# Introduction to Git

Welcome, version control hero! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ready to save your code and track every change? Git is your time machine for projects. It lets you record, rewind, and collaborate‚Äîso you never lose your work.

Git is a tool that helps you manage changes to files over time. It‚Äôs used by developers everywhere, from solo coders to huge teams. By the end of this section, you‚Äôll know what Git is and why it‚Äôs essential for every coder.

## What is Git?

- **Created in 2005** by Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux).
- **Distributed**: Everyone has a full copy of the project history.
- **Tracks changes**: See who changed what, when, and why.

## Why Use Git?

- Undo mistakes easily
- Work with others without overwriting each other
- Keep a history of your project
