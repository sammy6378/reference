# GitHub Workflow

You’re doing great! Now, let’s learn how to share your code online and collaborate with others using GitHub.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a website for hosting Git repositories. It lets you:
- Store your code in the cloud
- Collaborate with others
- Track issues and pull requests

## Typical Workflow

1. **Create a repository on GitHub**
2. **Clone it to your computer**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
3. **Make changes, commit, and push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your changes"
   git push
   ```
4. **Open a pull request** to suggest changes

:::tip
Always pull the latest changes before you start working: `git pull`

## What's Next?

Time to practice! Try a mini project: [Git Projects](./projects.md).
