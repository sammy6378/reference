# Accessibility & SEO Basics

Make your site usable for everyone and easy to find! Accessibility means everyone—including people with disabilities—can use your site. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) helps your site show up in search results.

## Accessibility
- Always use `alt` attributes for images:
  ```html
  <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cute cat" />
  ```
- Use semantic HTML (like `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) for better screen reader support.
- Ensure good color contrast and keyboard navigation.

## SEO Basics
- Use meta tags in the `<head>`:
  ```html
  <meta name="description" content="A personal blog about web development.">
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript, blog">
  ```
- Use headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) to structure content.
- Write descriptive link text (avoid "click here").

## Best Practices
- Indent and nest your code properly.
- Use comments to explain sections:
  ```html
  <!-- This is a comment -->
  ```
- Make your structure responsive (works on all devices).
