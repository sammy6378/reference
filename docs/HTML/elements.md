# HTML Elements

Great job starting your HTML journey! üèóÔ∏è Now, let‚Äôs talk about elements‚Äîthe building blocks of every web page.

## What is an Element?

An element is everything from the opening tag to the closing tag, including the content in between.

Example:

```html
<p>Hello, world!</p>
```

- `<p>` is the opening tag
- `Hello, world!` is the content
- `</p>` is the closing tag

## Common HTML Elements

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings (from biggest to smallest)
- `<p>`: Paragraph
- `<a>`: Link
- `<img>`: Image
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: Lists (unordered, ordered, list item)
- `<div>`: Generic container

Example:

```html
<h1>My Web Page</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
</ul>
```

You can nest elements inside each other for structure.
