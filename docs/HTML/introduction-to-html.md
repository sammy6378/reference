# Introduction to HTML

Welcome, web explorer! üåê Ready to build the foundation of every website? HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is where it all begins. Think of HTML as the structure of your house‚Äîthe walls, doors, and windows that shape your web pages.

## What is HTML & How It Works with CSS/JS

HTML is not a programming language‚Äîit's a markup language. It tells the browser what each part of your page is: headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) makes your pages beautiful, and JavaScript (JS) adds interactivity. Together, they create modern websites!

- **HTML**: Structure
- **CSS**: Style
- **JS**: Behavior

## Basic Document Structure

Every HTML page starts with a standard structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page. üöÄ</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser this is an HTML5 document.
- `<html>` wraps the whole page.
- `<head>` contains info about the page (not shown to users).
- `<body>` contains everything you see on the page.
