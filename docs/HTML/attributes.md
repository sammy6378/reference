# HTML Attributes

Awesome! Now let’s make your elements more powerful with attributes. Attributes add extra information to elements—like giving your car a color or your phone a ringtone.

## What is an Attribute?

Attributes go inside the opening tag and usually come in name="value" pairs.

Example:

```html
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
```

- `href` is the attribute name
- `https://example.com` is the value

## Common Attributes

- `href` (for links)
- `src` (for images)
- `alt` (alternative text for images)
- `id` and `class` (for styling and scripting)
- `style` (inline CSS)

Example:

```html
<img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cute cat" width="200" />
<p id="intro" class="highlight">Welcome!</p>
```

:::tip
Always use `alt` for images—it's good for accessibility!

Let’s build interactive pages! Next: [HTML Forms](./forms.md) to collect user input.
