Arrays are your data superstars—lists made easy! Next, we'll tackle objects to store key-value data like a pro. Hop to [Objects](./objects.md) and keep the vibe going. You're killing it! 🚀k of arrays as your digital backpack: you can stuff numbers, strings, or even other arrays inside, then pull them out whenever you need. Arrays are perfect for keeping track of things like to-do lists, scores, or your favorite emoji collection.

In this section, we’ll learn how to create arrays, use common methods to add or remove items, and loop through arrays to work with each item. It’s like organizing a playlist—easy, fun, and super powerful. Let’s get started! 🎉

## Creating Arrays: Your List Builder 📋

Arrays are ordered lists where each item has an index (starting at 0). You can store anything—numbers, strings, booleans, even mixed types!

### Ways to Create Arrays

1. **Array Literal (Simplest)**: Use square brackets `[]`.

   ```javascript
   let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
   console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
   console.log(fruits[0]); // apple (index 0)
   console.log(fruits[2]); // orange (index 2)
   ```

2. **Array Constructor**: Less common but works.

   ```javascript
   let numbers = new Array(1, 2, 3);
   console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3]
   ```

3. **Empty Array**: Start empty, fill later.

   ```javascript
   let tasks = [];
   tasks[0] = "Learn JS";
   console.log(tasks); // ["Learn JS"]
   ```

- Access items with `array[index]`.
- Get length with `array.length` (e.g., `fruits.length` is 3).
- Mix types? No problem: `let mix = [1, "hi", true];`

:::tip Pro Tip
Stick to `[]` for creating arrays—it’s shorter and clearer. Use `new Array()` only for special cases (like pre-sized arrays).
:::

:::warning Index Out of Bounds
`fruits[10]` gives `undefined` if the index doesn’t exist. Check `length` to stay safe!

## Common Array Methods: Your Toolkit 🛠️

Arrays come with built-in methods to add, remove, or find items. Here are the must-knows for beginners!

### push: Add to End

Adds one or more items to the array’s end. Grows the array!

```javascript
let pets = ["dog", "cat"];
pets.push("goldfish");
console.log(pets); // ["dog", "cat", "goldfish"]
pets.push("bird", "hamster"); // Add multiple
console.log(pets); // ["dog", "cat", "goldfish", "bird", "hamster"]
```

### pop: Remove from End

Removes (and returns) the last item. Shrinks the array!

```javascript
let last = pets.pop();
console.log(last); // "hamster"
console.log(pets); // ["dog", "cat", "goldfish", "bird"]
```

### shift: Remove from Start

Removes (and returns) the first item. Everything slides left.

```javascript
let first = pets.shift();
console.log(first); // "dog"
console.log(pets); // ["cat", "goldfish", "bird"]
```

### unshift: Add to Start

Adds one or more items to the start. Everything slides right.

```javascript
pets.unshift("turtle");
console.log(pets); // ["turtle", "cat", "goldfish", "bird"]
```

### indexOf: Find an Item

Returns the index of the first match, or -1 if not found.

```javascript
let index = pets.indexOf("cat");
console.log(index); // 1
console.log(pets.indexOf("dragon")); // -1 (not there!)
```

:::info More Methods
Want to explore? Try `slice`, `splice`, or `includes`. We’ll cover them later, but `pets.includes("cat")` checks if it’s there (true/false).
:::

:::warning Case-Sensitive
`indexOf("Cat")` won’t find "cat". JS is picky—match exactly!
:::

## Iterating Arrays: Loop the Loop 🔄

To work with each item, loop through the array. We’ll use `for` (classic) and `forEach` (modern and clean).

### For Loop: Full Control

Use when you need the index or want to customize.

```javascript
let scores = [85, 90, 95];
for (let i = 0; i < scores.length; i++) {
    console.log(`Score ${i + 1}: ${scores[i]}`);
}
// Output:
// Score 1: 85
// Score 2: 90
// Score 3: 95
```

Great for skipping items or breaking early.

### forEach: Clean and Simple

Runs a function for each item. No manual index management!

```javascript
scores.forEach((score, index) => {
    console.log(`Score ${index + 1}: ${score}`);
});
// Same output as above
```

- `score` is the item, `index` is optional.
- Can’t `break` or `continue`—runs fully.

Example: Emoji party!

```javascript
let emojis = ["😺", "🐶", "🐟"];
emojis.forEach(emoji => console.log(emoji + " is cute!"));
// 😺 is cute!
// 🐶 is cute!
// 🐟 is cute!
```

:::tip For vs. forEach
Use `for` for control (skip, break). Use `forEach` for simplicity when you just want to do something with each item.
:::

:::info For...Of Bonus
From last section: `for (let emoji of emojis) { ... }` works too! No index, just values.
:::

## Practice Time! 🛠️

Fire up your console and try:

```javascript
// Create and modify
let groceries = ["milk", "bread"];
groceries.push("eggs");
groceries.unshift("butter");
console.log(groceries); // ["butter", "milk", "bread", "eggs"]

// Pop and shift
let last = groceries.pop();
let first = groceries.shift();
console.log(last, first); // "eggs" "butter"

// Find index
console.log(groceries.indexOf("milk")); // 0

// Loop it
groceries.forEach(item => console.log(`Buy ${item}`));

// For loop with condition
for (let i = 0; i < groceries.length; i++) {
    if (groceries[i] === "bread") {
        console.log("Found bread at index " + i);
    }
}
```

Play: Add more items, find one that’s not there, or skip an item in the loop.
