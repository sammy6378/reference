# Intermediate JavaScript

Welcome to Intermediate JavaScript! ðŸŽ¯

You've mastered the basicsâ€”variables, functions, arrays, and objects. Now it's time to level up with intermediate concepts that will make your JavaScript more powerful and professional.

## What You'll Learn

- **Advanced Functions**: Callbacks, higher-order functions, and scope mastery
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Promises, async/await, and handling API calls
- **DOM Deep Dive**: Advanced DOM manipulation and event handling
- **Error Handling**: Try/catch, debugging techniques, and error management
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ features, destructuring, and spread operators
- **Data Structures**: Maps, Sets, and when to use different data types
- **Code Organization**: Modules, best practices, and clean code principles

## Prerequisites

You should be comfortable with:

- Basic JavaScript syntax (variables, functions, loops)
- Arrays and objects fundamentals
- Basic DOM manipulation
- HTML and CSS basics

Need a refresher? Check our [JavaScript Beginner](../Beginner/introduction-to-javascript.md) section.

## Coming Soon

We're actively developing comprehensive intermediate tutorials covering:

- **Callback Functions**: Understanding and using callbacks effectively
- **Promises & Async/Await**: Modern asynchronous programming
- **Advanced DOM**: Event delegation, performance optimization
- **Error Handling**: Professional debugging and error management
- **ES6+ Features**: Destructuring, spread/rest, template literals
- **API Integration**: Fetch API, handling responses, and error states
- **Code Organization**: Modules, imports/exports, and project structure

1. **Start with Callbacks**: Understand function passing and execution
2. **Master Promises**: Learn modern async programming
3. **DOM Mastery**: Advanced event handling and performance
4. **Error Handling**: Professional debugging techniques
5. **Modern Features**: ES6+ syntax and best practices
6. **Real Projects**: Apply concepts in practical applications
