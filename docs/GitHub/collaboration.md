# Collaboration on GitHub

GitHub makes it easy to work with others. Common collaboration features include:

## Forking
Copy someone else's repository to your own account to make changes without affecting the original.

## Cloning
Download a repository to your computer to work on it locally.

## Pull Requests
Suggest changes to a repository. The owner can review and merge your changes if approved.
