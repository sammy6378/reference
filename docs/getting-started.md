2. [TypeScript Introduction](./Typescript/intro) - Add types to JavaScript for safer code.
3. [React Setup](./React/setup) - Set up your React environment.
4. [React Native Setup](./react-native/setup) - Get ready for mobile app development.

### For Experienced Developers

Ready to level up? Dive into advanced topics:

- [Intermediate JavaScript](./Javascript/Intermediate) - Master promises, async/await, and ES modules.
- [TypeScript Tips](./Typescript/tips) - Explore generics, utility types, and advanced patterns.

- [React Native Components](./react-native/components) - Create stunning mobile UIs.

## üõ† Prerequisites

To ensure a smooth start, set up the following tools:

- **Node.js** (v18.x or higher, LTS recommended):
  - Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
  - Verify installation: Run `node --version` and `npm --version` in your terminal.
  - **Tip**: Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions easily.

- **Code Editor**:
  - We recommend [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
  - Install extensions like **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and **TypeScript** for a better coding experience.

- **Git** (for version control):
  - Install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
  - Verify: Run `git --version` in your terminal.
  - **Optional**: Set up a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account for project hosting.

- **Package Manager** (optional but recommended):
  - Use **npm** (comes with Node.js) or install **pnpm** [](https://pnpm.io/) for faster dependency management.
  - Verify: Run `npm --version` or `pnpm --version`.

- **Basic Programming Knowledge**:
  - Familiarity with variables, functions, and basic logic is helpful but not required.
  - If you're new, our [JavaScript Basics](./Javascript/Beginner/introduction-to-javascript) section will guide you step-by-step.

**Troubleshooting Setup**:

- Can‚Äôt install Node.js? Check [Node.js troubleshooting](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/troubleshooting).
- Git issues? See [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).
- Need help? Ask in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/sammy6378/reference/discussions).
