# Introduction to React Native

## What is React Native

React Native is an open-source UI software framework developed by Meta Platforms. It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use the React framework along with native platform capabilities.

## Prerequisites

To work with React Native, you will need to have an understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and basic 
React.js, HTML and CSS is a Plus.

React Native is supported by contributions from individuals and companies around the world including Callstack, **Expo**, Infinite Red, Microsoft and Software Mansion.

## Expo Framework

Expo is a framework that makes developing Android and iOS apps easier. The framework provides file-based routing, a standard library of native modules, and much [more](https://expo.dev).


## Why use Expo framework for development

The primary reasons to use Expo with React Native include:

**Simplified Build Process:** Expo streamlines the build process for generating native app binaries, making it easier to prepare applications for distribution on app stores.

**Simplified Setup and Development:** Expo handles much of the complex native setup and configuration, allowing developers to focus on writing JavaScript code and quickly get started with building their applications without deep knowledge of native development environments.

**Access to Pre-built Modules and APIs:** Expo offers a wide range of pre-built modules and APIs for common device functionalities (e.g., camera, location, notifications), reducing the need to write custom native code for these features.

**Rapid Prototyping and Iteration:** Expo's managed workflow provides tools like Expo Go for instant testing on devices, simplifying the testing process and enabling faster iteration cycles.

**Managed Workflow and Tooling:** Expo provides a comprehensive set of tools and services, including Expo CLI, Expo Application Services (EAS), and Expo Router, which enhance the entire development lifecycle from coding to deployment.

**Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates:** Expo enables seamless over-the-air updates for JavaScript and asset changes, allowing for quick bug fixes and feature deployments without requiring app store submissions.
